# GreenMap
These Green Map stencils can be used for marking [Green Map](https://www.greenmap.org)  [Icons](https://www.greenmap.org/make-map/green-map-icons) on surfaces. 

We used them with environmentally friendly, washable berry-based paint to mark sites in the city to learn about our own urban environment. 

The stencils were made by Helsinki Green Map. Take the file to your nearest laser cutter and cut out the stencil on cardboard or thin plywood.
